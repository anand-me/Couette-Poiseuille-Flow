# Couette-Poiseuille-Flow

This repository is dedicated to the <code>individual research project</code> during the masters program <a href="https://centralelille.fr/en/aeronautic-space-major-turbulence/" rel="nofollow">International Master's in Turbulence (IMP-Turbulence)</a> at École Centrale de Lille, France 2017-2019. 

## Introduction
The repository contains the work done on computation of Couette-Poiseuille flow with a mixing-length model of turbulence. This work
was done as of part of turbulence practices - <code>Individual Research Project</code> at École centrale de Lille, France as a part of
Masters program in Turbulence. The project was a supervised of Dr. Jean-Philippe LAVAL.

<code>Objective:</code> 
To write a simple program for a turbulent model for a simplified case and compare the results with the <code>theoritical solutions</code> in                         the <code>laminar case</code> and with the <code>experimental</code> results in <code>turbulent case</code>. Several parameters such as grid stretching, number of grid points near the walls are investegated.

## General definition
<code>Couette ﬂow</code> can be described as the ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid between two parallel surfaces one of which is moving tangentially relative to the other.
The ﬂow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the ﬂuid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the ﬂow direction which is then a case combined with the <code>Poiseuille ﬂow</code>. <code>Shear-driven ﬂuid motion</code> is one of the most common example of couette flow.
